"""
Exercise: Employee Directory Joins
Module 3 | Lesson 4 | ~35 min

Objective:
  Write INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN queries across three related tables to
  answer real-world HR questions. Understanding the difference between
  INNER JOIN (only matching rows) and LEFT JOIN (all left rows, NULLs
  for non-matches) is a critical SQL skill.
