Exercise: Library Analytics
Module 3 | Lesson 5 | ~35 min

Objective:
  Write analytical SQL queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions
  (COUNT, AVG), and subqueries. These tools turn raw rows into insights.

Key concepts:
  - GROUP BY collapses many rows into one row per group.
  - Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX, SUM) compute values across the group.
  - HAVING filters AFTER grouping (WHERE filters BEFORE grouping).
  - Subqueries let you use the result of one SELECT inside another.
